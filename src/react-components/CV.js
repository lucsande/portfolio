                Developed a house-made recipe for theatrical blood, which was
                washable and could be produced in large quantities despite of a
                very restricted budget. After two days of research and
                experimenting, I came up with an original recipe that looked
                realistic and costed less than R$15,00 per liter.

                this short movie yielded good ties with the others involved and
                well over one year after it I was still getting invitations to
                take part in other productions.
